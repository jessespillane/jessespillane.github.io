# All My Solo Albums are Now cc-by

All of my solo albums are now licensed as [cc-by (creative commons
attribution)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  Previously I had my last two releases, ‘The Maddening
Parade’ and ‘Sky Ship’, were cc-by-nc, which disallowed commercial
use. Older releases were already cc-by.  Please note that the non-solo
work like Eighth Whale and Dusklight Trio are not part of creative
commons and are covered by standard copyright.

Now there is no need for going through all the mental gymnastics
required to figure out whether your use of the music is or isn’t
commercial in nature.

I updated bandcamp, free music archive, and archive.org pages to show
the updated licence. Enjoy!
