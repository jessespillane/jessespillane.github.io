# Techno EP (2015)

For no particularly good reason, I just put some really old music on
my bandcamp page.  These are three songs I made in fruity loops over
10 years ago.  I didn’t know what I was doing. Maybe there is some
charm to my cluelessness, but…probably not.

Posting this mostly serves to embarrass myself.
