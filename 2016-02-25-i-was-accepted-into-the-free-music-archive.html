          I was recently accepted into the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">free music archive</a> under the ccCommunity section!

            The Free Music Archive is an interactive library of high-quality, legal audio downloads directed by WFMU, the longest-running freeform radio station in the United States. Every mp3 on the Free Music Archive is pre-cleared for certain types of uses that would otherwise be prohibited by copyright laws that were not designed for the digital era. These uses vary and are determined by the rightsholders themselves.

          If you get a chance, browse around the FMA. It’s been one of my favorite websites for discovering creative commons music for a while, and I’m honored to be a part of it. In the short time I’ve been on the site as an artist, I’ve probably received way more downloads than I deserve. I’m really happy to have reached a larger audience and I hope they enjoy my work!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the near future, I’ll write a new post with some of my favorite discoveries from the FMA.
