# New album released, Sky Ship

I just released a new album called [Sky Ship](music.html) with
various material recorded between 2010 and 2015. I'm proud of what I
came up with. I spent too much time on it, mostly letting my inner
critic talk me down. 

Some of the individual songs have been on the internet in some form or
another for quite some time. Like this one:

That was 2011, 3 apartments ago. Weird.

Coming soon, I have songs finished for another solo record which tends a little
more towards electronics and general weirdness.
