# I Was Accepted into the Free Music Archive

I was recently accepted into the
[free music archive](http://freemusicarchive.org/) under the
ccCommunity section!

To quote [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Music_Archive):

> The Free Music Archive is an interactive library of high-quality,
> legal audio downloads directed by WFMU, the longest-running freeform
> radio station in the United States. Every mp3 on the Free Music
> Archive is pre-cleared for certain types of uses that would
> otherwise be prohibited by copyright laws that were not designed for
> the digital era. These uses vary and are determined by the
> rightsholders themselves.

If you get a chance, browse around the FMA.  It’s been one of my
favorite websites for discovering creative commons music for a while,
and I’m honored to be a part of it. In the short time I’ve been on the
site as an artist, I’ve probably received way more downloads than I
deserve.  I’m really happy to have reached a larger audience and I
hope they enjoy my work!

In the near future, I’ll write a new post with some of my favorite
discoveries from the FMA.
