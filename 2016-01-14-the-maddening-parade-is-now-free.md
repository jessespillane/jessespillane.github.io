# The Maddening Parade is Now Free (and cc-by-nc)

I gave up on trying to hold my music hostage in exchange for people
writing me haikus.  You can now download the album for free.  To those
that wrote me, thanks!

The bandcamp link is still the same:

I’m eventually going to put it up in other places.

Essentially: do whatever the hell you want with it as long as you give
me proper credit and don’t use it for commercial purposes.
