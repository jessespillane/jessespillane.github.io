# The Long Hunt - Wilderness Tales


Trevor and Allison, who I played with in [Eighth
Whale](http://eighthwhale.bandcamp.com/) and [Dusklight
Trio](http://eighthwhale.bandcamp.com/), just released an album along
with Mark Lyons as part of their new band [The Long
Hunt](https://listentothelonghunt.com/). And by “just released”, I
mean “a month ago”.  Jesse Spillane dot com is probably not your
source of up to date news.

It’s a really cool album.  They describe the release as follows:

> The songs on Wilderness Tales are typically slower, sprawling,
> meditative, and sparse- a mood sometimes contrasted with the
> occasional outburst, dense arrangement, or driving repetition. The
> music sits comfortably in the experimental, psych and alternative rock
> categories while occasionally incorporating elements of desert, drone
> and post rock reminiscent of bands like Earth, Grails, and OM.

It’s certainly a departure from the Eighth Whale, which was
consciously not minimal. Stream it below:

If you like it, throw them some money and buy it. I highly recommend
it. If you are in the Pittsburgh area, which I no longer am (I
defected to Cleveland), go see their show on [April 1st at
