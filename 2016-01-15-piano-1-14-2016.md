I decided to record a video of me playing since I haven’t done that in
a while. This is a song I wrote many years ago. It has a kind of
pseudo-classical vibe to it which I usually don’t pursue. The playing
is a little sloppy. Eventually I want to do a better recording of
it. Perhaps alongside other musicians.
