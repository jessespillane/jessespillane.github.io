# New website. New Eighth Whale music.

The website has a new look.  I wrote a crappy static website/blog
generator bash script which is tied together with grep, sed, and
bubble-gum. I wanted to feel like MacGyver, I guess.

In more exciting news, new Eighth Whale albums! We released a
self-titled "studio" album orginally recorded in 2011. The album is
properly aged, and ready for the world. You can find it on
[bandcamp](https://eighthwhale.bandcamp.com/album/eighth-whale). I also have a
page on my website [here](music.html).

Eighth Whale also j ust released a "new" live album originally recorded
at Howler's in 2010 (our concept of new is broken).  Find it at
[bandcamp](http://eighthwhale.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-howlers). I have a
page [here](music.html) too.

Eighth Whale is on one of those indefinite hiatuses bands sometimes go
on. Sometimes life gets in the way. Trevor, Allison, and DJ are all
incredibly talented and creative musicians.  I am extremely lucky to
have made noise with them. Eighth Whale is dead. Long live Eighth Whale!
