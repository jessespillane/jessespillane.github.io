# Trevor Richards - (((HUM)))

I’m a couple days late, but Trevor Richards just released a new album
entitled “(((HUM)))”.  It is a really fun to listen to album.  I think
it is perfect for driving on a highway at 2am.

I had the honor of playing on three of the tracks (keyboards and
clarinet).  The album has a really cool mix of “band” style songs with
moody electronic music.

I played on $SPACE, Voice of the Mountain Voice of the Sky, and
Memorial.  Check it out below:
