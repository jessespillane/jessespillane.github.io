# New Album - The Maddening Parade

On a whim, I decided to finally press the publish button on bandcamp.
I’m proud to present my new album, “The Maddening Parade”.  I hope you
enjoy!

Edit (1/14/2016): It’s now free <s>The price is currently set at 7
dollars, but if you write me a comment in this blog post with a haiku
(or really any form of poem), I’ll send you a download code. Hint: I’d
prefer a haiku!</s>

You can find it on the [music](music.html) page
