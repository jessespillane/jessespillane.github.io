# Support the Free Music Archive

The free music archive is an awesome resource to find genre defying
music gems for use within your projects or just for your listening
enjoyment. The music on the site is mostly released under various
kinds of creative commons licenses, making them great choices for use
in media such as video. They very kindly host my
[solo music](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jesse_Spillane/) and
help bring it to the attention of people all over the world. Consider
donating to the website if you make use of their generous archive. See
the embedded widget below, or visit
